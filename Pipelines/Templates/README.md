# Do's and Don'ts
- Do not make breaking changes
- Use a branch to test if new pipeline still works (ref parameter is branch name)
- Do make new versions when a breaking change happens
- New pipelines should always end with a version number "new-pipeline.1.yml"
- Do not delete templates in use
- Add deprecation notice in old template if you make a new better one. Use [warning.1.yml](tools/warning.1.md)
- Use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Azure Pipelines extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azure-devops.azure-pipelines) when editing pipelines.
